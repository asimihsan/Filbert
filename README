Filbert is the Android front-end for ArtiCheck.

TODO

-   Create a dummy condition report layout with a bunch of text
    fields, check boxes, radio buttons, in a scroll view, just
    to make sure it works.
    
-   Rotate and confirm the condition report becomes the only part
    of the screen.  Rotate again and confirm we go back to a
    list + condition report view.
    
-   Given a form layout JSON string create a condition report
    layout.    
    
-   Add ability to represent a type of form with a given media.  For
    example, if the media is "Painting" then want to have a certain
    set of fields, field types, and field values. 
    
    Field types:
        -   Text.
        -   Checkbox (from fixed set of values).
        -   Radio group (from fixed set of values).
        
    Represent this data in an SQL table as JSON.  Use the JSON to
    populate the layout of the condition report from scratch.
    
-   On selection of a given condition report load the correct JSON
    string from the SQL table and then create the layout.    

-   Selecting a condition report will pop open a new list, with e.g.
    -   Basic info.
    -   Painting type.
    -   Noticeable damage.
    
-   Some of these list items will depend on what media type you've
    selected.  These items will be encoded as JSON in the SQL
    table somehow (a given media will have several JSON strings,
    each helping to populate this list and the condition report).

-   Add ability to take photographs using the tablet and associate
    them with the current condition report.  No editing at this stage.
