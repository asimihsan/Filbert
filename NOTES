-   JD's sketches are invalid.  They only display currently selected
    checkboxes, whereas a CR must show both selected and unselected
    checkboxes because these are two distinct pieces of data; we not
    only assert some elements are true but that some elements are false.
    
    Hence, must show all selectable checkboxes/radio boxes, and
    appropriately select those which are selected.
