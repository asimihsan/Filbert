Filbert is the Android front-end for ArtiCheck.

TODO

-   Tabs on top of right-hand pane for CR sections.

-   Spend 30min refactoring code, making it more maintainable.
    Mark as X when done, and every few days re-add as a TODO
    task.
    
    (In this iteration at least move all JSON decoding into 
    ConditionReport/Template, out of fragment).

-   Style the fragments a-la Google I/O 2011 / Gmail.
    
-   JavaDoc everything.

-   Start a technical document for the internals.    
    
-   Selecting a condition report will pop open a new list, with e.g.
    -   Basic info.
    -   Painting type.
    -   Noticeable damage.    
    -   Photographs
    
    Some of these list items will depend on what media type you've
    selected.  These items will be encoded as JSON in the SQL
    table somehow (a given media will have several JSON strings,
    each helping to populate this list and the condition report).  
    
-   Complete the database loop - changes to CR is saved back to the
    database every five seconds in some background task and onPause().
    
-   Rotate and confirm the condition report becomes the only part
    of the screen.  Rotate again and confirm we go back to a
    list + condition report view.        

-   Add ability to take photographs using the tablet and associate
    them with the current condition report.  No editing at this stage.
    No storage.
    
-   Save photographs into some standard location in on-device memory.
    Store "file pointers" within SQL database.  Save with a thumbnail.
    
-   Make the photograph fragment for a condition report load up
    the thumbnails for the CR in a grid-type view.  Do not attempt to
    load all thumbnails at once; some background task to load and
    make it available to the fragment.  If a thumbnail isn't loaded
    display some placeholder.
    
-   Clicking on a photograph thumbnail loads a new fragment that
    contains just the photograph in a bigger view.  Still no
    annotations.

DONE

X   Create a dummy condition report layout with a bunch of text
    fields, check boxes, radio buttons, in a scroll view, just
    to make sure it works.
    
X   Given a form layout JSON string create a condition report
    layout.    
    
X   Add ability to represent a type of form with a given media.  For
    example, if the media is "Painting" then want to have a certain
    set of fields, field types, and field values. 
    
    Field types:
        -   Text.
        -   Checkbox (from fixed set of values).
        -   Radio group (from fixed set of values).
        
    Represent this data in an SQL table as JSON.  Use the JSON to
    populate the layout of the condition report from scratch.
    
X   On selection of a given condition report load the correct JSON
    string from the SQL table and then create the layout.
